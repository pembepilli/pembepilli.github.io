Unlike dogs, cats are often independent and can take care of themselves to some extent, making them popular pets for many households.</h3>

				<h3>Cats come in various breeds, sizes, and colors, with some having short fur and others having long, fluffy coats. They communicate through meows, purring, and body language, using their tails and ears to express emotions. Cats are also known for their playful nature and curiosity, often exploring their surroundings and engaging in activities like chasing toys or climbing furniture.</h3>

				<h3>Aside from being loving companions, cats provide practical benefits such as pest control, as they naturally hunt mice and insects. They require minimal grooming and can be litter-trained, making them low-maintenance pets. With proper care, a cat can live for 12 to 20 years, forming a deep bond with its owner over time.</h3>
