				<h3>Cats were domesticated around 9,000 years ago in the Near East. Unlike dogs, cats likely domesticated themselves by associating with human settlements to hunt vermin. Over time, they became beloved companions, known for their independent yet affectionate nature.</h3>

				<h5>Scientifically, domestic cats are classified under the kingdom Animalia, phylum Chordata, class Mammalia, order Carnivora, family Felidae, genus Felis, and species Felis catus. Their physical traits make them excellent hunters. Cats have retractable claws, which they use for climbing, self-defense, and catching prey.</h5>

				<h5>They also have sharp eyesight adapted for low-light environments, allowing them to hunt effectively at night. Their hearing is extremely acute, enabling them to detect higher-pitched sounds than humans or dogs. Additionally, a catâ€™s sense of smell is well-developed, helping them track scents even in faint quantities.</h5>
